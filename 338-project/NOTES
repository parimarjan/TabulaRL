ARS:
    - implement BRS + ARS, and test on all these environments

DeepSea:
    - add this environment and test all the algorithms

New environments to add:
    - openai tabular ones
        - CartPole homework
        - inverted pendulum
        - others?

Questions to explore:
    - what is map_mdp() in epsilonGreedy / in general differences between these
    agents and the ones we were implementing for the homework...

    - what does the scale parameter do
    - what is it about stateBanditMDP that makes epsilon greedy perform better
    than UCRL?
